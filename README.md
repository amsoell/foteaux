# Foteaux

Foteaux is a safety-first photo sharing service

## Social Networks Bad

[Several](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344195460_Getting_Fewer_Likes_Than_Others_on_Social_Media_Elicits_Emotional_Distress_Among_Victimized_Adolescents) [studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616645673) show that social media is a growing problem for adolescents, and the focus on getting the maximum number of likes and followers can lead to decreased happiness and quality of life. Foteaux is a service that allows users to share their photos, but cuts out the social aspects that can cause these negative effects.

Beyond that, Foteaux has been an excuse to implement some software skills that are of a particular interest to me:

+ [OpenAPI documentation](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/)
+ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
